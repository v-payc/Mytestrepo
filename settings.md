# Customize Service Fabric cluster settings and Fabric Upgrade policy
This document tells you how to customize the various fabric settings and the fabric upgrade policy for your Service Fabric cluster. You can customize them on the portal or using an Azure Resource Manager template.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all settings may be available via the portal. In case a setting listed below is not available via the portal customize it using an Azure Resource Manager template.
> 

## Customizing Service Fabric cluster settings using Azure Resource Manager templates
The steps below illustrate how to add a new setting *MaxDiskQuotaInMB* to the *Diagnostics* section.

1. Go to https://resources.azure.com
2. Navigate to your subscription by expanding subscriptions -> resource groups -> Microsoft.ServiceFabric -> Your Cluster Name
3. In the top right corner, select "Read/Write"
4. Select Edit and update the `fabricSettings` JSON element and add a new element

```
      {
        "name": "Diagnostics",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "MaxDiskQuotaInMB",
            "value": "65536"
          }
        ]
      }
```

The log will not be allowed to truncate to a size below this setting. 0 indicates that the replicator will determine the minimum log size according to other settings. Increasing this value increases the possibility of doing partial copies and incremental backups since chances of relevant log records being truncated is lowered. |

Increasing the number of replica sets increases the level of reliability for the information in the Naming Service Store; decreasing the change that the information will be lost as a result of node failures; at a cost of increased load on Windows Fabric and the amount of time it takes to perform updates to the naming data.|
|MinReplicaSetSize | Int, default is 3 | The minimum number of Naming Service replicas required to write into to complete an update. If there are fewer replicas than this active in the system the Reliability System denies updates to the Naming Service Store until replicas are restored. This value should never be more than the TargetReplicaSetSize. |
|ReplicaRestartWaitDuration | Time in seconds, default is (60.0 * 30)| Specify timespan in seconds. When a Naming Service replica goes down; this timer starts.  When it expires the FM will begin to replace the replicas which are down (it does not yet consider them lost). |
|QuorumLossWaitDuration | Time in seconds, default is MaxValue | Specify timespan in seconds. When a Naming Service gets into quorum loss; this timer starts.  When it expires the FM will consider the down replicas as lost; and attempt to recover quorum. Not that this may result in data loss. |
|StandByReplicaKeepDuration | Time in seconds, default is 3600.0 * 2 | Specify timespan in seconds. When a Naming Service replicas come back from a down state; it may have already been replaced.  This timer determines how long the FM will keep the standby replica before discarding it. |

| MaxOutstandingNotificationsPerClient |Int, default is 1000 |The maximum number of outstanding notifications before a client registration is forcibly closed by the gateway. |
| MaxIndexedEmptyPartitions |Int, default is 1000 |The maximum number of empty partitions that will remain indexed in the notification cache for synchronizing reconnecting clients. Any empty partitions above this number will be removed from the index in ascending lookup version order. Reconnecting clients can still synchronize and receive missed empty partition updates; but the synchronization protocol becomes more expensive. |
| GatewayServiceDescriptionCacheLimit |Int, default is 0 |The maximum number of entries maintained in the LRU service description cache at the Naming Gateway (set to 0 for no limit). |
| PartitionCount |Int, default is 3 |The number of partitions of the Naming Service store to be created. Each partition owns a single partition key that corresponds to its index; so partition keys [0; PartitionCount) exist. Increasing the number of Naming Service partitions increases the scale that the Naming Service can perform at by decreasing the average amount of data held by any backing replica set; at a cost of increased utilization of resources (since PartitionCount*ReplicaSetSize service replicas must be maintained).|

|QuorumLossWaitDuration |Time in seconds, default is MaxValue | Specify timespan in seconds. The QuorumLossWaitDuration for ClusterManager. |
|StandByReplicaKeepDuration | Time in seconds, default is (3600.0 * 2)|Specify timespan in seconds. The StandByReplicaKeepDuration for ClusterManager. |
|PlacementConstraints | string, default is "" |The PlacementConstraints for ClusterManager. |
|SkipRollbackUpdateDefaultService | Bool, default is false |The CM will skip reverting updated default services during application upgrade rollback. |
|EnableDefaultServicesUpgrade | Bool, default is false |Enable upgrading default services during application upgrade. Default service descriptions would be overwritten after upgrade. |
|InfrastructureTaskHealthCheckWaitDuration |Time in seconds, default is 0| Specify timespan in seconds. The amount of time to wait before starting health checks after post-processing an infrastructure task. |
|InfrastructureTaskHealthCheckStableDuration | Time in seconds, default is 0| Specify timespan in seconds. The amount of time to observe consecutive passed health checks before post-processing of an infrastructure task finishes successfully. Observing a failed health check will reset this timer. |
|InfrastructureTaskHealthCheckRetryTimeout | Time in seconds, default is 60 |Specify timespan in seconds. The amount of time to spend retrying failed health checks while post-processing an infrastructure task. Observing a passed health check will reset this timer. |
|ImageBuilderTimeoutBuffer |Time in seconds, default is 3 |Specify timespan in seconds. The amount of time to allow for Image Builder specific timeout errors to return to the client. If this buffer is too small; then the client times out before the server and gets a generic timeout error. |
|MinOperationTimeout | Time in seconds, default is 60 |Specify timespan in seconds. The minimum global timeout for internally processing operations on ClusterManager. |
|MaxOperationTimeout |Time in seconds, default is MaxValue | Specify timespan in seconds. The maximum global timeout for internally processing operations on ClusterManager. |
|MaxTimeoutRetryBuffer | Time in seconds, default is 600 |Specify timespan in seconds. The maximum operation timeout when internally retrying due to timeouts is <Original Timeout> + <MaxTimeoutRetryBuffer>. Additional timeout is added in increments of MinOperationTimeout. |
|MaxCommunicationTimeout |Time in seconds, default is 600 |Specify timespan in seconds. The maximum timeout for internal communications between ClusterManager and other system services (i.e.; Naming Service; Failover Manager and etc). This timeout should be smaller than global MaxOperationTimeout (as there might be multiple communications between system components for each client operation). |
|MaxDataMigrationTimeout |Time in seconds, default is 600 |Specify timespan in seconds. The maximum timeout for data migration recovery operations after a Fabric upgrade has taken place. |
|MaxOperationRetryDelay |Time in seconds, default is 5| Specify timespan in seconds. The maximum delay for internal retries when failures are encountered. |
|ReplicaSetCheckTimeoutRollbackOverride |Time in seconds, default is 1200 | Specify timespan in seconds. If ReplicaSetCheckTimeout is set to the maximum value of DWORD; then it's overridden with the value of this config for the purposes of rollback. The value used for rollforward is never overridden. |
|ImageBuilderJobQueueThrottle |Int, default is 10 |Thread count throttle for Image Builder proxy job queue on application requests. |
