# Customize Service Fabric cluster settings and Fabric Upgrade policy
This document tells you how to customize the various fabric settings and the fabric upgrade policy for your Service Fabric cluster. You can customize them through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or using an Azure Resource Manager template.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all settings are available in the portal. In case a setting listed below is not available via the portal customize it using an Azure Resource Manager template.
> 

## Customize cluster settings using Resource Manager templates
The steps below illustrate how to add a new setting *MaxDiskQuotaInMB* to the *Diagnostics* section.

1. Go to https://resources.azure.com
2. Navigate to your subscription by expanding **subscriptions** -> **resource groups** -> **Microsoft.ServiceFabric** -> **\<Your Cluster Name>**
3. In the top right corner, select **Read/Write.**
4. Select **Edit** and update the `fabricSettings` JSON element and add a new element:

```
      {
        "name": "Diagnostics",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "MaxDiskQuotaInMB",
            "value": "65536"
          }

| ExpectedClusterSize|int, default is 1|Dynamic|When the cluster is initially started up; the FM will wait for this many nodes to report themselves up before it begins placing other services; including the system services like naming.  Increasing this value increases the time it takes a cluster to start up; but prevents the early nodes from becoming overloaded and also the additional moves that will be necessary as more nodes come online.  This value should generally be set to some small fraction of the initial cluster size. |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TargetReplicaSetSize |Int, default is 7 |Not Allowed|The number of replica sets for each partition of the Naming Service store. Increasing the number of replica sets increases the level of reliability for the information in the Naming Service Store; decreasing the change that the information will be lost as a result of node failures; at a cost of increased load on Windows Fabric and the amount of time it takes to perform updates to the naming data.|
|MinReplicaSetSize | Int, default is 3 |Not Allowed| The minimum number of Naming Service replicas required to write into to complete an update. If there are fewer replicas than this active in the system the Reliability System denies updates to the Naming Service Store until replicas are restored. This value should never be more than the TargetReplicaSetSize. |
|ReplicaRestartWaitDuration | Time in seconds, default is (60.0 * 30)|Not Allowed| Specify timespan in seconds. When a Naming Service replica goes down; this timer starts.  When it expires the FM will begin to replace the replicas which are down (it does not yet consider them lost). |
|QuorumLossWaitDuration | Time in seconds, default is MaxValue |Not Allowed| Specify timespan in seconds. When a Naming Service gets into quorum loss; this timer starts.  When it expires the FM will consider the down replicas as lost; and attempt to recover quorum. Not that this may result in data loss. |
|StandByReplicaKeepDuration | Time in seconds, default is 3600.0 * 2 |Not Allowed| Specify timespan in seconds. When a Naming Service replica come back from a down state; it may have already been replaced.  This timer determines how long the FM will keep the standby replica before discarding it. |

| MaxIndexedEmptyPartitions |Int, default is 1000 |Dynamic|The maximum number of empty partitions that will remain indexed in the notification cache for synchronizing reconnecting clients. Any empty partitions above this number will be removed from the index in ascending lookup version order. Reconnecting clients can still synchronize and receive missed empty partition updates; but the synchronization protocol becomes more expensive. |
| GatewayServiceDescriptionCacheLimit |Int, default is 0 |Static|The maximum number of entries maintained in the LRU service description cache at the Naming Gateway (set to 0 for no limit). |
| PartitionCount |Int, default is 3 |Not Allowed|The number of partitions of the Naming Service store to be created. Each partition owns a single partition key that corresponds to its index; so partition keys [0; PartitionCount) exist. Increasing the number of Naming Service partitions increases the scale that the Naming Service can perform at by decreasing the average amount of data held by any backing replica set; at a cost of increased utilization of resources (since PartitionCount*ReplicaSetSize service replicas must be maintained).|

| **Parameter** | **Allowed Values** |**Upgrade Policy**| **Guidance or short Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|PropertyGroup|KeyDoubleValueMap, default is None|Dynamic|Determines the set of MetricBalancingThresholds for the metrics in the cluster. Balancing will work if maxNodeLoad/minNodeLoad is greater than MetricBalancingThresholds. Defragmentation will work if maxNodeLoad/minNodeLoad in at least one FD or UD is smaller than MetricBalancingThresholds. |

### Section Name: NodeBufferPercentage
| **Parameter** | **Allowed Values** |**Upgrade Policy**| **Guidance or short Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|PropertyGroup|KeyDoubleValueMap, default is None|Dynamic|Node capacity percentage per metric name; used as a buffer in order to keep some free place on a node for the failover case. |

### Section Name: Replication
| **Parameter** | **Allowed Values** | **Upgrade Policy**| **Guidance or short Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|MaxCopyQueueSize|uint, default is 1024|Static|This is the maximum value defines the initial size for the queue which maintains replication operations.  Note that it must be a power of 2.  If during runtime the queue grows to this size operation will be throttled between the primary and secondary replicators.|
|BatchAcknowledgementInterval|TimeSpan, default is Common::TimeSpan::FromMilliseconds(15)|Static|Specify timespan in seconds. Determines the amount of time that the replicator waits after receiving an operation before sending back an acknowledgement. Other operations received during this time period will have their acknowledgements sent back in a single message-> reducing network traffic but potentially reducing the throughput of the replicator.|
|MaxReplicationMessageSize|uint, default is 52428800|Static|Maximum message size of replication operations. Default is 50MB.|
|ReplicatorAddress|string, default is L"localhost:0"|Static|The endpoint in form of a string -'IP:Port' which is used by the Windows Fabric Replicator to establish connections with other replicas in order to send/receive operations.|
|ReplicatorListenAddress|string, default is L"localhost:0"|Static|The endpoint in form of a string -'IP:Port' which is used by the Windows Fabric Replicator to receive operations from other replicas.|
|ReplicatorPublishAddress|string, default is L"localhost:0"|Static|The endpoint in form of a string -'IP:Port' which is used by the Windows Fabric Replicator to send operations to other replicas.|
|MaxPrimaryReplicationQueueSize|uint, default is 1024|Static|This is the maximum number of operations that could exist in the primary replication queue. Note that it must be a power of 2.|
|MaxPrimaryReplicationQueueMemorySize|uint, default is 0|Static|This is the maximum value of the primary replication queue in bytes.|
|MaxSecondaryReplicationQueueSize|uint, default is 2048|Static|This is the maximum number of operations that could exist in the secondary replication queue. Note that it must be a power of 2.|
|MaxSecondaryReplicationQueueMemorySize|uint, default is 0|Static|This is the maximum value of the secondary replication queue in bytes.|
|QueueHealthMonitoringInterval|TimeSpan, default is Common::TimeSpan::FromSeconds(30)|Static|Specify timespan in seconds. This value determines the time period used by the Replicator to monitor any warning/error health events in the replication operation queues. A value of '0' disables health monitoring |
|QueueHealthWarningAtUsagePercent|uint, default is 80|Static|This value determines the replication queue usage(in percentage) after which we report warning about high queue usage. We do so after a grace interval of QueueHealthMonitoringInterval. If the queue usage falls below this percentage in the grace interval|
|RetryInterval|TimeSpan, default is Common::TimeSpan::FromSeconds(5)|Static|Specify timespan in seconds. When an operation is lost or rejected this timer determines how often the replicator will retry sending the operation.|

### Section Name: Transport
| **Parameter** | **Allowed Values** |**Upgrade policy** |**Guidance or short Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|ResolveOption|string, default is L"unspecified"|Static|Determines how FQDN is resolved.  Valid values are "unspecified/ipv4/ipv6". |
|ConnectionOpenTimeout|TimeSpan, default is Common::TimeSpan::FromSeconds(60)|Static|Specify timespan in seconds. Time out for connection setup on both incoming and accepting side (including security negotiation in secure mode) |
